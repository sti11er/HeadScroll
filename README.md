# Head Scrolling

HeadScroll a package that allows you to scroll the text of the page by tilting your head in left or right.

When the head is tilted to the left, the text will scroll down.
When the head is tilted to the right, the text will scroll up.
npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/head_scroll) 

It would be convenient to make a HeadScroll plugin for google. How I tried to do this and why I did not succeed I wrote in my telegram channel.
